# Foundation of Machine Learning & Neural Architectures (MLOM Lab Activities)

This repository is a comprehensive showcase of machine learning algorithms, data engineering workflows, and deep learning implementations. It transitions from fundamental Pythonic data structures to complex neural network architectures using TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🚀 Key Learning Modules

### 1. Neural Networks & Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)
* **MLP Classification:** Building and tuning Multi-Layer Perceptrons to predict health outcomes (Diabetes dataset).
* **Deep Regression:** Implementing neural networks for price prediction using the Boston Housing dataset, focusing on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) optimization.
* **Architecture Design:** Experimenting with layer depth, dropout, and activation functions for optimized convergence.

### 2. Algorithmic Implementations (From Scratch & Scikit-Learn)
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A mathematical deep-dive into SVMs. Includes custom optimization using `scipy.minimize` and visualization of decision boundaries on the Iris dataset.
* **Linear Regression:** Statistical modeling of relationships (e.g., Salary vs. Experience) using both `statsmodels` and `sklearn`.



### 3. Data Engineering & Preprocessing
* **Scaling & Standardization:** Detailed comparisons between `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, and Robust scaling techniques to handle variance and outliers.
* **Advanced Pythonics:** High-performance data manipulation using List Comprehensions and optimized NumPy operations.
* **Outlier Management:** Systematic detection and replacement strategies to ensure model stability.

### 4. Specialized Domains
* **Computer Vision:** Basic image processing and edge detection using **OpenCV (cv2)**, specifically implementing Canny Edge Detection.
* **Information Retrieval:** Implementation of an **Inverted Index**—the foundational logic behind search engines—mapping terms to document IDs.
